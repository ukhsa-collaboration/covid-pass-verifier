## NHS COVID Pass Verifier Application
The section demonstrates the usage of the NHS COVID Pass Verifier and how it is used in conjunction with the COVID 2D barcodes that are issued via the web application.

<details>
	<summary> NHS COVID Pass Verifier Overview </summary>

### How to use the NHS COVID Pass Verifier

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47818141/122911997-c96a5c00-d34f-11eb-85b6-61ac7c410f67.png" width="180">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47818141/122912133-e9018480-d34f-11eb-86fe-62e9f78fd967.png" width="180">
</p>


Upon navigating to the NHS COVID Pass Verifier application, you will first be met with the initial landing page. This page is the first page in the application where you are always able to navigate back to or progress to the COVID Pass Verifier.

The ”Check a 2D barcode” button will navigate you to the COVID Pass Verifier where you will be able to direct the camera at a users 2D barcode. To do this the users 2D barcode, which will be either on their device or printed out, will need to be placed inside the four blue square guidelines as seen above.
	
The NHS COVID Pass Verifier is aligned with the 1.3.0 EU schema, where more information can be found [here](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-schema). 
	
### COVID Pass Verifier Results (International)
<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47818141/122913146-01be6a00-d351-11eb-8bd3-41e51095c533.png" width="180">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47818141/122930849-3c7dcd80-d364-11eb-8839-896739473ee3.png" width="180">
</p>

Once the COVID Pass Verifier has been pointed at a 2D barcode, it will automatically be verified without the user needing to press anything. Above you can see 2 images and these represent the 2 International outcomes from scanning a QR code. The 2 images in order along with their meanings are:

* **International**: The service enables the user to scan COVID 2D barcodes, to see if they have obtained any immunity via vaccinations. Therefore, this will assist in the reopening of society, focusing on international travel to display if you are vaccinated.  The NHS COVID Pass Verifier follows the [EU Digital Green Certificate](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development) standard which this application can interpret and represent the data regarding an individual on this application. The data represented will show the verifier the vaccinations taken by the 2D barcode holder, it will display either 1 or many cards where each card represent a dose of vaccination. Each card will hold information regarding a vaccination such as the dose number, the manufacturer, authority administering the vaccine and more.
* **Recovery**:  When a 2D barcode is scanned it can also display recovery results. This does not represent and individual’s vaccination(s), rather it represents an individual who has recovered from Covid-19. This data is generated and based on test results of the individual. The 2D barcode verifier will show information such as the country of the test, the issuer of the certificate, date of first positive result and more. Just like the International results the recovery results is based [on EU Digital Green Certificate](https://github.com/ehn-digital-green-development) standard.

Once the cards are shown the user can click Dismiss and return to the COVID Pass Verifier.

### COVID Pass Verifier Results (Domestic)

<p align="center">

</p>


Once the COVID Pass Verifier has been pointed at a 2D barcode, it will automatically be verified without the user needed to press anything. Above you can see 3 images and these represent the 3 outcomes from scanning a domestic 2D barcode. These 3 images in order along with their meanings are:

* **Valid** : The 2D barcode that has been scanned is valid and they have been verified. This, therefore, means they will be allowed to enter the sporting fixture, theatre or other public events.

* **Expired** : The 2D barcode that has been verified was once valid however, it has been too long since they have last obtained a COVID pass. This means that they are not allowed into the event as they are not able to provide recent evidence they are COVID free.

* **QR code not recognised** : The 2D barcode was not recognised by the COVID Pass Verifier. This could be due to parts of the 2D barcode being obscured thus not being able to recognise if the COVID pass is valid or expired.


The date and time displayed on each pass show when they are due to expire (20 Apr 2021 at 09:14).

If you need more time to look at the COVID Pass Verifier result, you can hold the screen. Doing this will pause the natural timer set in the application which is visualised via the white progress bar located above the displayed name. Upon releasing the screen press, this timer will continue to countdown, returning to the COVID Pass Verifier ready to scan the next 2D barcode.

## Terms and Conditions

<details>
	<summary> Terms and Conditions </summary>

### 1. Introduction

1.1.	Welcome to the terms of use (“Terms”) for the NHS COVID Verifier App (“Verifier App”). The Department of Health and Social Care (‘DHSC’, ‘we’, ‘our’) has overall responsibility for the Verifier App, which has been developed by, and will be operated by, NHSX (a joint working arrangement between DHSC and NHS England).

1.2.	These Terms apply to the Verifier App only. There are separate terms of use that apply to the NHS COVID Pass Service (“Service”) – those terms can be viewed here: https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk/help/TermsAndConditions/.
	
### 2. Purpose of the Verifier App
	
2.1.	The purpose of the Verifier App is to allow the device (onto which the Verifier App is downloaded) to scan and read a 2D barcode produced by the Service, which contains information associated with the Service user’s digital ‘COVID Pass’. This certificate confirms that the Service user has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or has met negative testing or natural immunity requirements. The certificate can be used by the Service user to demonstrate their COVID Pass for the purposes of international travel, or for domestic purposes (which the Government may approve from time to time).

2.2.	The Verifier App is only designed for use in conjunction with the Service, and must not be used for any other purpose.  

2.3.	The Verifier App is provided by DHSC free of charge, and it is expressly prohibited to attempt to sell or license use of the Verifier App to any person, or to include the Verifier App as part of a paid-for service or product. 

2.4.	International barcodes are only to be checked by travel operators for the purposes of verifying an individual's COVID Pass and determining if it meets the international destination’s requirements needed. The service must not be used for any other purpose. 

### 3. How to use the Verifier App
	
3.1.	To use the Verifier App, you must first download it from the Apple App store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nhs-covid-pass-verifier/id1546716320 or Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.dhsc.healthrecord.

3.4.	International results: the international 2D Barcode Code represents the COVID Pass of an individual person, it follows a set international standard designed by eHealth Network (Part of the European Commission), and all developers who develop COVID related applications follow this set standard. It is intended to be used for international travel. 

3.5.	Domestic results: the Domestic results of a COVID-19 2D barcode can hold two possible statuses. The first being Valid which represents a valid vaccination certificate of an individual user, the second status is Expired showing an expired vaccination certificate of an individual user. When represented on the app the verifier will see the Name, Status, and date of expiry. 

3.6.	About your data: The NHS COVID Pass Verifier application reads 2D barcodes that store personal data and allows the verifier to read and display this information. However, this information gathered from the 2D barcode is never stored or transmitted on the NHS COVID Pass Verifier application. App permissions are used to securely store keys that are used to verify a 2D barcode has been signed by a trusted authority.
